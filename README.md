Acorns is Albert's largest competitor, with 3.5 million monthly active users investing $50-60 dollars a month.

## Metrics

Albert's core metrics would be their financial performance, customer satisfaction, learning and growth, and internal business processes. Financial metrics include but are not limited to Net Present Value (NPV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Operating Profit, Net Yield, and Monthly Growth. These metrics help identify if the company is generating enough revenue, are acquiring your customers at a low enough cost, and the relationship is profitable.

## Recommendations

Albert's product offering has a healthy amount of room for improvement. It lacks some key features, namely essential banking services such as checking and savings accounts, and doesn't offer rewards from brands or retailers like other apps such as Acorns. 

Albert also misses the mark with its target age group by only offering automatic savings when a user gets paid instead of a daily feature that would continually engage users. This feature is probably not enabled since Albert has yet to launch its debit card and corresponding checking account. Although, from their website, it appears that it is on the horizon very soon. 

On the investment side, Albert would be wise to implement fractional share ownership products that would help individuals invest in companies and markets that were once only attainable at high price points. This feature could bring in a new set of users that don't have any investing experience or strategy. In conjunction, they could use Robo-advising to compliment their "human-geniuses" recommendations. Offering these additional services could Edge Albert become a complete all-in-one platform for budgeting, saving, investing, lending, and day to day banking. While other competitors have some of those features, very few have them all.

## New Product Tech

Albert can utilize use AI to automate functions (i.e., Robo advising); 
and distributed ledgers and Blockchain technology to increase the speed of transactions, thus making it more profitable.
